# About

The `twirl-maven-plugin` allows to use the [Play Framework Scala template engine](http://www.playframework.org/documentation/2.0/ScalaTemplates)
in the Maven build lifecycle, especially to compile templates as part of the compilation phase. It is similar to the
[twirl sbt plugin](https://github.com/spray/twirl) but for Maven projects.
